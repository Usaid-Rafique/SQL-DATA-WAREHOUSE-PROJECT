# SQL-DATA-WAREHOUSE-PROJECT
Building a data warehouse with SQL Server consisting of ETL processes, data modeling, and data analytics.
Welcome!!
This project showcases a comprehensive data engineering and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. This is my first project and will serve as my portfolio project. I am developing this project under the guidance of DatawithBarra. It is a good starting point for beginners who are planning to enter the data engineering field and trying to understand industry standards. 

Objective::
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

Specifications::
  Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
  Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues before analysis.
  Integration: Combine both sources into a single user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
  Scope: Focus on latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
  Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
